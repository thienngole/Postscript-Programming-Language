# Postscript-Programming-Language
Hello,
My name is ThienNgo Le. I am currently doing my bachelor of computer science at Metropolitan State University of Denver. In this repository I Wrote four different Postscript programs that draw pictures.
a.	a business card (elegant, with more than just your name and phone number)
b.	a CS data structure or similar (array, list, tree, Turing machine, other) with some data (e.g., ints) and words (e.g., “head”)
c.	a geometric form, possibly recursive (spirals, Serpinski triangles, multiple overlapping rectangles in different colors, etc.)
d.	A company logo that uses many PostScript capabilities
